            I came to the United States about 17 years ago. Starting and
            adapting to a new country was not easy. The death of my father
            shortly after arriving changed my life and many of my goals had to
            be put on standby in order to help my mother with my two brothers.
            Although these circumstances were not the best, I am grateful that
            despite the difficulties, both I and my family were able to move
            forward and resume our path without forgetting the principles that
            our father instilled in us and the determination to go behind our
            dreams.
            <br />

            I dedicated myself for a long time to the medical field but I always
            felt my passion for Real Estate. My parents were always independent
            contractors and I always had in mind to do the same. I have always
            liked reading about real estate investments and helping my family in
            the sale and purchase of real estate. When the pandemic affected my
            work, I felt that my opportunity to go after my dream had arrived
            and in March 2020 I began to swim in this very rewarding career.
            <br />
            <br />
            For me, real estate is the path to many of my dreams including the
            dreams that my father could not fulfill. Thanks to this beautiful
            career, my husband and I have started our business in Ecuador. 123
            hectares dedicated to the production of Abaca and other forest
            trees. This is not only our great project but also the way to create
            a source of work in this region that needs it so much, being one of
            the ways to share the many blessings received.
            <br />
            <br />
            During these two years I have learned so much not only from my coach
            but the different extraordinary people that are part of Keller
            Williams. I feel fortunate to belong to a company that truly cares
            about each one of us and our clients. I prepare myself every day so
            as not to disappoint the trust that my clients put in me and to
            offer the best experience during a real estate transaction.
