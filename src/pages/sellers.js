          Thereâ€™s a lot that goes into selling your house, and it takes time,
          effort, and expertise to truly do it right. Before you decide to sell
          your house yourself, let's discuss your options to make sure you get
          the most out of your sale.

          Open Houses
        </p>
        <p>
          Open houses are one of the best ways to create
          exposure for your property, and I can confidently assure
          you that there's more to open houses than just putting out 
          signs with balloons!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Open houses make the preview of your property efficient for 
          you and for the buyers -<strong>especially for the ones
            who aren't working with an agent.
          </strong> These come through your home in one day and you
          avoid having to prepare your home for different appointments
          for buyers previewing your property separately.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Before the open house, I will advertise especially heavily, and set up phone
          mail campaings to make the neighborhood aware of the event. I place
          no fewer than 5 signs; all within heavy traffic areas in the morning
          on the day of the open house.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          During the open house, I will determine the motivation and 
          seriousness of each buyer, and also gauge any constructive
          input that they may have. I also have a system to follow up with every
          open house guest within 24 hours. I will be able to answer
          all of their questions while their home is still fresh in their minds - making it 
          more likely to get another appointment and possibly an offer.
