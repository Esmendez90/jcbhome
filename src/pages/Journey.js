            I came to the United States about 17 years ago. Adapting to the new
            culture and lifestyle was very challenging. On top of that, the
            death of my father shortly after completely changed my life. My
            goals had to be put on standby in order to help my mother raising my
            two younger siblings. Against all odds, my family and I were able to
            move on with our lives, and keep the principles that our father
            instilled in us, and the determination to chase our dreams close to
            our hearts.

            As a young adult, I started my career in the medical field and spent
            a decent amount of years working with people with diverse
            backgrounds. I enjoyed my work and the people that surrounded me;
            however, I always felt a passion for real estate. I continuously
            studied about real estate investments and eagerly assisted my family
            in the sale and purchase of properties. Back home, my parents were
            both independent contractors and their example motivated me to want
            to do the same... to be my own boss. When my job was affected by
            covid-19, I realized that my opportunity to go after my dream had
            finally arrived, and in March 2020 I began building my path in this
            rewarding career.

            Real estate is to me the modus operandi to fullfil my dreams,
            including those that my dad would have loved to see become a
            reality. Thanks to this career, my husband and I have started an
            ambitous business in Ecuador. A hundred and twenty three acres of
            land dedicated to the production of abaca and other goods. This is
            not only our life project, but also a way to generate a number of
            jobs in this region that needs it so much. For us, this is a way to
            share with others the many blessings we have received.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my first two years as a real estate agent, I have learned so
            much from my coach and the extraordinary people that are part of
            Keller Williams. I feel fortunate to belong to a company that truly
            cares about each one of us and our clients. This is why I work hard
            every day so as not to disappoint my clients and the trust confided
            in me, and to offer the best possible experience during a real
            estate transaction.
